# eda_for_data_science_and_ml
This repo emphasizes the need for EDA in a data science workflow. In this notebook, we'll deal with missing values, one-hot encoding, handling multicollinearity, and data transformation. Finally we will also construct a correlation matrix and visualize features to gain meaningful insights.
